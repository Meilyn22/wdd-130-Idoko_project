        <h1 class="center-text">Steps to building a website</h1>
        <img class="image-inpost" src="images\website.jpg" alt="building a website">

        <p> Developing a website can be challenging for many, but planning your website can make it a lot easier. Small businesses now understand the need for creating a website to help expose their business to as many people as possible. Traditional advertising is fading out; people are rushing online to sell goods and services. <br> <br>
            The question is, “how do I go about building a website?” What are the necessary steps needed to plan and build a useful website for a business? We are here to help you answer that question. Here are some of the things you can do. <p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>What is the purpose of your website?</h2>
                <img class="image-inpost" src="images\purpose.jpg" alt="purpose of website">
                    <p>The first thing to consider before building a website is the purpose. Is it a personal blog, or is it a place where I want to showcase my products and services? After thinking about the website’s purpose, you can begin to think about the website structure.<p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Build a wireframe.</h2>
                <img class="image-inpost" src="images\wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe">
                <p>Wireframes are essential for websites, just like architects are essential when it comes to building a house. The structure of the house is first constructed on a piece of paper or a computer program. Then the builders begin to use that prototype to build the house. A wireframe helps you see the website before it’s made. That’s where you will determine what color you want to use for your website, what you want the homepage to look like, and how you want your customers to see your website. Many people go as far as design their entire website with programs like photoshop before giving it to a web developer to code.<p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Find a developer.</h2>
                <p>After you must have put everything down on paper or a computer program, you can now hand the wireframe over to a web developer to create. Make sure your wireframe contains every single detail, like the logo and pictures you want to display. The videos you wish to include and the text you want to show on every page. Many web developers will teach you how to handle most of the functions when they are done.<p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Test your website.</h2>
                <img class="image-inpost" src="images\testing.jpg" alt="testing">
                <p>Before you go live with your website, you need to test every function built to make sure it fits your needs. It’s never too late to change things you don’t like. It’s always good to have friends and family help with testing your website. For example, if you have a website where people order products. Make sure you try to order products and note all the steps.<p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Go live.</h2>
                <p>Now that your website is ready, you can go live.<p>
            </li>
        </ol>
