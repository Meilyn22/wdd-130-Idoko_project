        <h1 class="center-text">How building a website for your business can increase exposure. </h1>
        <img class="image-inpost" src="images\exposure.jpg" alt="exposure">

        <p> Many small businesses in the United States and the world are using the web to gain more exposure for their products and services. Using the internet to showcase products and services isn’t new. The rate at which companies, small businesses, and other entities use the internet to get customers has skyrocketed in the last few years.  <br> <br>
            Do you have a small business? We will tell you how to gain more customers by just owning a website. The few points below explain why every small business should have a website. <p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>A website can help you automate your business.</h2>
                <img class="image-inpost" src="images\automate.jpg" alt="automation">
                    <p>Many small businesses rely on the word of the month. They say the same thing to all customers with word of the month, which might be tiring. Owning a website can make things easier. You could write a description of your product and share that with potential customers instead of explaining everything from scratch. You could also make a video in any language of your choice and upload it on your website to help explain your product. <br> <br></p>
                    <p>Things get more comfortable when customers can find all the information they need in one place. Building a website for your business helps you to accomplish this.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>A website can help with pre-orders.</h2>
                <img class="image-inpost" src="images\package.jpg" alt="package">
                <p>Instead of coming to your shop or store to buy products, your customers can order online and then pick up at the time they want. Many customers want their products packaged before they get to your store. Owning a website will certainly make it easy to get it done. </p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Owning a website can help with shipping products.</h2>
                <img class="image-inpost" src="images\shipping.jpg" alt="shipping">
                <p>What if you had a website where customers can pick what they want to buy and put up their addresses so the products can be shipped to them? Owning a website can help you accomplish this, especially if your customers are far away.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

                <p>Owning a website can help expose your business to people far and wide. You don’t have to travel to another country to display your product. A website gives you a better option of displaying your products on the web and showing your customers all over the world. <br> <br>
